          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
        <h3>Question 1:</h3>
        <p>Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Don't fight it, use what happens. And right there you got an almighty cloud. And maybe a little bush lives there.</p>


        <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <p>You can create anything that makes you happy. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Just use the old one inch brush.</p>

        <h3>Question 3</h3>

        <p>This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. This piece of canvas is your world. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue.</p>

        <h3>Question 3</h3>

        <p>Let's get wild today. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.</p>

        <h3>Question 5</h3>
