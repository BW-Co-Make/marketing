        <h2>Local problems ,  Local solutions</h2>
        <p>  
          The light is your friend. Preserve it. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.
          Get tough with it, get strong. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Brown is such a nice color.
          Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. See there, told you that would be easy. What the devil. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.
        </p>
        <h2>Our mission!</h2>
        <p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Let's do that again. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it.
          There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. This is a fantastic little painting.
          Working it up and down, back and forth. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. We'll have a super time. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.
          I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
